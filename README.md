Zigato & Family Laboratory: 

Zigato is the family name of Mr. Kwabena Acheampong and Mrs. Esther Lartey. 
This nuclear family has four men and a girl. Life was not easy growing up for them as youngsters, 
since down the line, their father lost his job. Things became a hard nut to crack for the family, since they had to resort to subsistence farming for a living. 
Through perseverance, hard work, and determination, 
the family of five children was able to break through the toughness life came up with by also developing tough skin when life became hard. 
Two of the men are medical practitioners in the United States and is a civil engineer in the United Kingdom. The other two are pursuing their Ph.D. in academics. 
Unfortunately, they lost their father in 2023. At the funeral, where this nuclear family came for a reunion, 
they decided to establish a large laboratory within and surrounding their town to serve as a memorial for their family,
using the family name “Zigato & Family Laboratory”. Due to their dispersed manner in terms of location, 
they were trying to figure out how to interactively monitor activities going on in the laboratories
to be able to make informed decisions through transparency within the family (stakeholders) in coordinating the smooth running of the three laboratories to be established. 
How could they monitor the interactions in the laboratories closely, even though they are not close, realistically? 
This has been their headache, having in mind the challenges partnerships may pose in situations of distanced parties and inadequate transparency. 
Interoperation was their barrier as stakeholders in trying to manifest their dream to come true as family, though as partners in this firm to be established.
